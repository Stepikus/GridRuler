# GridRuler
GridRuler is ImageJ plugin for analysing (counting and measuring) particles inside grid (such as spores inside Burker chamber or Red blood cells inside Neubauer chamber-hemocytometer).
GridRuler is able to recognise lines of grid, these lines are then used as reference size for measurment of particles. (Therefore it is called gridRuler)
GridRuler will do analysis of all your pictures in selected folder.
