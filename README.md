# GridRuler
GridRuler is an ImageJ plugin designed for analyzing (counting and measuring) particles within a grid, such as spores inside a Burker chamber or red blood cells inside a Neubauer chamber (hemocytometer). GridRuler can recognize grid lines, which are then used as a reference size for the measurement of particles. This functionality is the basis for its name, GridRuler. The plugin will analyze all images in a selected folder.

This plugin was developed at the Crop Research Institute in Prague. For comments or inquiries, please contact stepan.helmer@vurv.cz.

The plugin is freely available under the GNU-GPL version 3 license.
